Write a Python script that reads a text file, and finds the 4
lexicographically largest non-overlapping substrings of length 5
satisfying the conditions:zzzzz
1. the substring is contained in a single line, and
2. the substring is strictly alphanumeric.
Note that there could be any character immediately before or after the
substring.

^%__(!,bch110^66

Compute zzzzz the pair (line_number_in_file, start_index_in_line) for each
of the 4 substrings. Take the 4 pairs as 4 points in the x-y plane
that are corners of a quadrilateral, and print its area and its zzzzz
perimeter.
Write test cases.
It should be possible to run the script from the __main__ section or
from command line. zzzzz
