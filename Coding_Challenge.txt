Question -1

####
Write a Python script that reads a text file, and finds the 4
lexicographically largest non-overlapping substrings of length 5
satisfying the conditions:
1. the substring is contained in a single line, and
2. the substring is strictly alphanumeric.
Note that there could be any character immediately before or after the
substring.

Compute the pair (line_number_in_file, start_index_in_line) for each
of the 4 substrings. Take the 4 pairs as 4 points in the x-y plane
that are corners of a quadrilateral, and print its area and its
perimeter.
Write test cases.
It should be possible to run the script from the __main__ section or
from command line.

Question-2

####
Write a Python script that reads an image from a file as grayscale,
and finds the four non-overlapping 5x5 patches with highest average
brightness. Take the patch centers as corners of a quadrilateral,
calculate its area in pixels, and draw the quadrilateral in red into
the image and save it in PNG format. Use the opencv-python package for
image handling. Write test cases.
It should be possible to run the script from the __main__ section or
from command line.
